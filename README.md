This project is created using **React** Framework and **MUI** Library. It utilized Firebase services (RTDB, Hosting, and Storage).

The project is a simple form logging web app. Allows user to input data into the form and attach files. Admin can check the the forms submitted on the dashboard. Admin can generate PDF based on form data.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Cloud Infrastructure Design

The web app utilizes the following firebase services: Firebase Realtime Database, Firebase Storage, and Firebase Hosting. Firebase Realtime Database is a NoSQL cloud-hosted database provided by Firebase. It allows developers to store and synchronize data in real-time across multiple clients, such as web and mobile applications. Firebase Storage is a cloud storage service provided by Firebase. It allows developers to store and serve user-generated content, such as images, videos, and other files, in a secure and scalable manner. Firebase Hosting is a service provided by Firebase that allows developers to easily host their web applications and static content. It provides a fast and secure way to deploy and serve web assets such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
